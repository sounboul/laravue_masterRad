Laravel framework is my specialty, I learn Vue.js recently, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases are
types of databases that I work with. I work in Linux Ubuntu OS where I use LAMP as a local
environment. From Source Version Control I have dealing with Github and Bitbucket. The Apache
server configuration is well known to me.
The last project I worked on was the Loyalty Program (https://laravue.bexter.rs - email: manager@laravue.dev password: laravue), (developed in Laravel 7 and Vue.js 2.6) which can be integrated into any e-shop (API) from whose database integration with MailChimp is performed for the purpose of automated sending of advertising messages / campaigns.
